The Small State Institute
=========================

A portal of policy proposals for future and current right-wing politicians. An open-source in development think-tank, seeking to provide web-applications and algorithms to facilitate a further shrinking of the state.

The current layout of the website is the homepage, 3 web applications and 4 overarching policy areas to be developed in the future.
